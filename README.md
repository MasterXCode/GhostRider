# GhostRider
Powerful DDOS Attack . made in python3 by me 

# Setup for Termux

```
 chmod +x *.py *.sh

 ./setup-termux.sh

```
# Setup for other Linux distros

```
 chmod +x *.py *.sh

 sudo ./setup-linux.sh

```
# Check

• Make sure you have installed a ``` python3.9.x ``` package to make sure that the script works

# Info

•This tool is a powerful "DOS" { Denial Of Service } Attack script . it's totally editable by the user . this script can almost shut down a website by one or two attacks
you can edit the number of threads this script use but keep in mind not to exceed 500,000 threads to avoid crashing of your device

•You can also edit the script to show the number of sent requests during the attack but it may slow down your attack a little bit

# Important

• You need to have python3.9 installed 

• For termux reduce the number of threads to 7765 or use the termux version of the script

• For other linux distros you can edit it freely but not to exceed 500,000
